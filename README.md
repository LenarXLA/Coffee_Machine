What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? 
A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. 
It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; 
but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. 
The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; 
if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. 
Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
